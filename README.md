# jig-visualizer
A model loosely based on the Vari-Grind jig. It uses leg angle, protrusion, and v-pocket distance as input parameters to visualize bevel profile. An 8" grinding wheel is hard-coded, and wheel wear is not accounted for. Jig leg length is arbitrarily set at 5". A 0.5" gouge, with a 0.2" web is hard-coded, and has no particular flute profile.
